## Description

It started as a personal project to apply all backend knowledge aquired during 20h talent bootcamp into a simple api to store user profiles for my team's project [the cv mobile app](/projects/cv-mobile-web). But after a couple of weeks it started to serve as a common api to the rest of projects at the bootcamp. It stores user profiles, their skills and languages, company profiles, their job offers, surveys and summaries with the answers to that surveys. With this project I learned to deploy a nodejs app with CD (continuous delivery), deploying a database, enviroment variables, object references, object population, jwt authentication, file uploading, and more.
